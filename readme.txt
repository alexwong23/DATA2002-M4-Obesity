# Project Description
Excess weight, especially obesity, has become an epidemic in the 21st century. This study aims to investigate an alternative method to deter- mine “overweight” individuals oppose to body fat percentage. Two al- ternative indicators are considered - BMI and body density. The results showed that BMI can be explained the best using simple body measure- ment and the measurement on abdomen is the most important predictor in estimating all three methods. A simpler predictive model for obesity has been developed using measurements on chest, abdomen and bicep. Limitations and implications are discussed.
