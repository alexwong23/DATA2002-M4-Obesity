Predicting Obesity Using DASL Dataset
=======================================

Description
-------------------
Excess weight, especially obesity, has become an epidemic in the 21st century. This study aims to investigate an alternative method to determine “overweight” individuals oppose to body fat percentage. Two alternative indicators are considered - BMI and body density. The results showed that BMI can be explained the best using simple body measurement and the measurement on abdomen is the most important predictor in estimating all three methods. A simpler predictive model for obesity has been developed using measurements on chest, abdomen and bicep. Limitations and implications are discussed.
